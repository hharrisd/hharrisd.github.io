# Hi there,

I am a Software Engineer with more than a decade of coding, mainly focused on backend development.

I have experience with Python, PHP, and a bit of Java and Javascript. I’ve used Laravel and Django frameworks to build robust web applications and APIs. I’m currently learning FastAPI.

Likewise, I have had experience in leadership positions that have allowed me to thrive on organizational, communication, and coordination skills.

I currently work as a Senior Python - Django Developer. My activities are related to a platform backend: APIs building, development and optimizations of queries, and writing compelling, tested, and scalable code.

In addition to my experience, I hold a Bachelor of Informatics Engineering and a Specialization in Industrial Engineering and Productivity. Likewise, I am a Scrum Master Certified and a Design Thinking Professional Certified. I continuously keep learning on platforms like Coursera and Udemy. When I want to learn a new skill, I dive into documentation at a fast-paced.
